Challenge! Show the view/edit cart link in the sidebar
Here is a challenge for you. In this task, you'll use your previous knowledge of UI Components to override a default Knockout.js template.

I'll provide you with some general guidelines, but it's up to you to implement this task.

User Story / Summary
As a website visitor, I need to be able to click a link in the sidebar at any time during the checkout process, in order to view and edit my cart contents.

Details
The Magento core code contains a "View and Edit Cart" link that is displayed when matching specific conditions of the checkout. We'd like to instead change this so that it renders constantly.

Visual Mockup
The "View and Edit Cart" link to be displayed is located somewhere in the core code, and looks like this:

![Alt text](/var/www/html/magento/app/code/MageChamps/ViewEditLinkOnCartPageChallenge/view/frontend/web/images/view-edit-link.png "a title")

Technical Assumptions
There is a simple & elegant way to implement this update. Think about best practices as well as providing the user the ability to override your code updates in the future.
