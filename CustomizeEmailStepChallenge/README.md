## Challenge! Customize the email step for logged in users
Oops! The Email checkout step that we created in this course is blanked for logged in users, so here is a challenge for you.

I'll provide you with some general guidelines, but it's up to you to implement this task.

### User Story / Summary
As a logged in user, I'd like to see my current email address in the Email checkout step, and update it if I need to.

### Details
Logged in users should be able to see the email address field just like logged out users. This gives them a chance to confirm their email address, and update if necessary.

If the user updates their email address, clicking Next should apply the updates to their account and update their related email address.

Be sure this code is backwards-compatible and still works for logged out users.

### Estimate
~8 hours (to account for the unknown)

When you are complete, be sure to submit your code in Campus for a chance to win M swag (a t-shirt or hoodie!).
