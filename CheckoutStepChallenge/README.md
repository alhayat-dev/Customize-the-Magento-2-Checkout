## Challenge! Add a step to the end of the checkout process
Here is a challenge for you. In this task, you'll attempt to add a new step to the end of the checkout process.

I'll provide you with some general guidelines, but it's up to you to implement this task.

### User Story / Summary
As a website visitor, I need to be able to submit my doctor's name and phone number before placing an order.

### Details
Our site sells prescription contacts, and we need to be able to confirm user's prescriptions with their order. In order to do this, we would like to request the user's doctor name and phone number on a new step in the checkout process.

The checkout step should come last, after all other default checkout steps. The display should be two input fields.

### Technical Assumptions
There is no need to save the data or pass it to an API at the moment, as that will be implemented in a future task. However, so you understand where to do this, issue a console.log somewhere in the code where it would be a great place to send this data to an internal or external API call.

Hint: There may be an elegant way to implement your "after place order" logic ðŸ˜‰.

### Estimate
~4 hours (don't worry if it takes longer ðŸ˜œ)



When you are complete, be sure to submit your code in Campus for a chance to win M swag (a t-shirt or hoodie!).
